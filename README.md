# GSRI Survey Review
As an Instructional Design and Outreach Specialist for the UW Libraries' Office of Learning Services (OLS), I am performing data analysis and visualization of survey respondents from the [Graduate Student Research Institute](https://sites.uw.edu/libid/), or GSRI, a yearly multi-day online workshop offered by OLS to help incoming graduate students understand research.

## Purpose
GSRI is undergoing changes. For the upcoming Summer 2023 iteration, the workshop was recently transitioned from Canvas, UW's learning management system (LMS), to [UW Sites](https://sites.uw.edu/), a UW static-site generator using Wordpress's engine.
<br><br>
Ideally, with this transition, we will have new changes in the content thanks to the structure of a static site vs. an LMS. To better inform the type of content we may need, I decided to take the lead and do some data visualizations, using R, on the survey data from a few previous GSRI iterations. 
<br><br>
It is my hope that the data analysis and visualization I perform will help us identify the information needs of incoming graduate students, so that they can be more successful in their time at UW and beyond. 

## Research Questions
- Are there certain academic fields and disciplines that are over- or under-represented within GSRI? And if so, can we add more specific content to their fields?
- Is there a higher rate of satisfaction with GSRI participants in the synchronous (Zoom and Slack) or asynchronous (Slack only) session? 
- Is there correlation between levels of engagement and overall confidence in graduate research and satisfaction with GSRI?
- Are UW graduate students overall satisfied with GSRI? Do they believe it is a good introduction to graduate-level work?
- How has graduate student satisfaction with GSRI changed over time?

## Limitations
This survey data is not fully representative of the GSRI participants:
- In the 2022 survey, **49.5% of the participants** (56 respondents out of 113 workshop participants) responded across the two sessions. Despite this, the samples received do encompass the diverse disciplines, academic interests, and engagement styles of the participants.
- In the 2021 survey, **36.7% of the participants** (43 respondents out of 115 workshop participants) responded, and the sample is mostly of students from the first session. This is a rather small sample size and is taken into consideration when working with the data.
<br>
It's tricky to work with this data as a result, because I'm not sure about the full spectrum of GSRI participants' responses and satisfaction. This is something to keep in mind.
## Findings
To be updated.

## Notes
- I'm wondering if I can get [U501](https://grad.uw.edu/for-students-and-post-docs/u501-graduate-school-orientation/) survey response data, as our office is doing competitor analysis with this program to see overlap and differences between U501 and GSRI, in a hope that it can better help us define the scope and content of our workshop: not sure if this would have to be a public records request or if I can just email the Graduate School asking for response data (they probably won't give it to me).
